# alpha #
Alpha is an ongoing project in Google Go.  
The goal is to build a full stack web-service (with React) and add it to my cloud for managing the top level of the cloud (UX). Also, should implement a few cool interior features. Working with microservices, ideally.  

I will be working with (and taking full advantage of) Cloud Native Go by Kevin Hoffman and Dan Nemeth.
